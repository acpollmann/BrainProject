    <p class = 'news_snippets'>Scientists appear to be traditionally smarter, and experts regarding what's going on in the world. However, magicians seem to have beat them to the catch, by conquering cognitive attention. There must be a distraction to properly fool the fool. Magicians are scientist in a way, by using their skills to trick the viewers. The skills that magicians use to misdirect the spectators, can be useful to Neuroscientist for their own scientific advantage...<span class = 'show-more'><a href = 'https://www.theodysseyonline.com/magicians-scientist'>Read More</a></span>...</p>

      <p class = 'news_snippets'>All of us are walking around with the capacity of the entire internet in our skulls, according to a recent study on neural computing power.

    <p class = 'news_snippets'>See, hear. Our eardrums appear to move to shift our hearing in the same direction as our eyes are looking.
